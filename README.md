Pretty Woman website

First website that we've built for a client.<br>
Tehnologies used: Bootstrap 4, HTML5, CSS3, PHP (for contact form, need to add filters) and a little bit of JavaScript for smooth scroll (need to fix, offset is not working properly).<br>
Take a look and tell us what you think. Thank you!<br>
